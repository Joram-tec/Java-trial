Akan Name Generator

Description

The Akan Name Generator is a web application that derives an Akan name based on a user's birthday and gender. This is inspired by Ghanaian culture, where many people do not know the exact day of the week they were born. The application assigns names traditionally given to children based on the day of the week they were born.
